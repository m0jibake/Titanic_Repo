## git Workflow

git status

git add <filename> --- add file to stageing area

git commit -m '<commit message>' --- commit all staged files on top of the current local branch

git push --- push all commits to the remote repo

git push -f --- force all commits on the remote repo. Required when local branch is behind -> remote repo will loose commits

git log --- display whole history of the current local branch

git log --oneline --- same as git log, but information is presented more consisely

git reflog --- show history, but also with merges and resets

git diff <filename> --- show differences between unstaged file and file that has been already commited

git revert <commit hash> --- Create new commit that undoes all of the changes made in <commit>, then apply it to the current branch

git fetch origin --- downloads new commits from the remote repo, but does NOT integrate them into the local repo. Required for git status to provide up todate info

git pull --- downloads new commits from the remote repo, and integrates them into the local repo

git commit --amend -m 'new commit message' --- change commit message of the last commit, if you haven't pushed yet. If you have already pushed, also do a git push -f

git reset --soft <commit hash> --- reset to <commit hash> and put all changes ever since into the stageing already

git reset --mixed <commit hash> --- reset to <commit hash> and put all changes ever sincec into the working directory 

git reset --hard --- reset to <commit hash> and throw all changes that happened ever since away. Also, working directory is cleaned.

git config --global --edit --- edit mail adress and name in editor
